gRPC Documentation:

The location request has a payload with userId, latitude and longitude. The protobuf defination is as below:

'''
message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 5;
    string latitude = 203;
    string longitude = 327;
}
'''

The gRPC server is hosted by the 'udaconnect-location-ingester' microservice on port 5005.

A sample gRPC client 'grpc_client.py' has been provided in the 'udaconnect-location-ingester' microservice 
to illustrate sending location data to the location ingester.


To test, run the following commands:

'''
export LOCATION_INGESTER_POD=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=udaconnect-location-ingester" \
-o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

kubectl exec -it $LOCATION_INGESTER_POD sh
'''

Once you are inside the shell, execute the grpc client with the command below:

'''
python grpc_client.py
'''
